#+title: Ludum Dare 35: Shapeshift

* Idea
- Geometric shape with different properties
  - a gear like form to climb wall
  - a round form to bounce...
  - triangle to make the word turn
  - square for move vertically or horizontally until blocked
- Maybe "eat" the different shape to gain them, or something like that
* Outil
